# RedWood3D
A 3D renderer Project to learn computer graphics programming fundamentals.

This Project is based on software rendering. (Refering to rendering process that is not dependent on graphics hardware).

I use SDL as a means to draw to a window. All other graphics elements will be coded from scratch.
